          <p> I am currently a student at New York Code and Design Academy as a Web Development 100 student. In this class, students are introduced to the fundamentals of web development. The class covers HTML,CSS, JavaScript and a bit of Ruby. Other topics discussed include, Git, Github, and the Command Line.I like the class so far; I'm glad I went through an online web design course and attended different meetups because I'm familiar with many of the things that have been taught so far.</p>

         <p> I am a web designer, front-end developer and writer from Irvington,NJ. Currently, I'm learning all I can about web design and front-end development. I can't wait to use my skills to build amazing websites and web apps that people can enjoy. I also enjoy writing and have written for publications such as Her Campus.When I'm not writing, coding or pushing pixels, I enjoy chai lattes and scouting Spotify and YouTube for the best music.

          <p> After the Web Development 100 course, students have the option of enrolling in one of four courses: Front End 101, Back End 101, UI/UX Design and iOS Development 101. Although I'm not yet sure of this, I'm thinking that I would like to take the Front End and Back End courses. I'm interested in the Front End course because I'm a very visual and I enjoy manipulating what users can see. I'm interested in the Back End beccause I'm interested in how websites and apps work. In short, I'm interested in the design and the functionality of an website and/or app.
